### What I Did

This project consisted of me pulling from a 3rd party API, with axios. Although
the API is not perfect and the names are not correct most of the time I still
got what i wanted because i fould filter through the prices,names(even if
incorrect).

### Continued development

I used tailwind here for the first time and loved it. I will continue to use
tailwind on different projects because my knowledge is limited I hope to get
better at making reusable react components.
